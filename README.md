# My Solidity Project

Welcome to my Solidity project! This project is developed using Remix IDE, a powerful online development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Project Overview

This project includes several Solidity smart contracts for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Contracts

1. **MyToken.sol**: An ERC20 token contract for creating fungible tokens.
2. **MyNFT.sol**: An ERC721 token contract for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open Remix IDE and import the Solidity files.
3. Compile the contracts and deploy them on the Ethereum testnet or a local blockchain.
4. Interact with the deployed contracts using Remix IDE or other Ethereum development tools.
